<h2> A 2-Dimensional Particle Swarm Algorithm Implementation </h2>

<p> This is an implementation of the Particle Swarm Algorithm for solving two-dimensional optimization problems </p>

<p> The code has a class *PSO* to which holds the required defitinion of the score function. Its is currently \$\$ x^{2} + y^{2} = z^{2} \$\$ </p>

<p> More support and animation will be added later </p>
